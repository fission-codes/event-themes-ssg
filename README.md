# Event themes for Static Site Generators

Many events just need a basic home page with standard event details -- date, venue + location, description, registration, agenda, speakers, sponsors.

The goal of this repo is to collect and bounty event-focused themes for static site generators.

## Bounty

### Description

_Describe the bounty that you want completed. What is it for? What does it involve?_

### Requirements

_What requirements do you have for bounty fulfillers? Are there any rules or constraints for your bounty? Are there any pre-requisites needed to complete it?_

### Definition of Done

_What should bounty issuers submit as proof that they have completed the bounty? What do fulfillers need to include in a submission in order for it to be accepted?_
